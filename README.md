# muscle-mgmt
Version 1 of CrossFit Gym member management system. Initial attempt made using AngularJS, Slim (and Twig), Chart.JS and SQL database. Future attempts will use NoSQL database and primarily JSON controls.  Current version functionality aims: a) staff members: view all athletes, search for single athlete, view analytics, b) athlete: view personal membership data. Known issues: POST requests trigger Error 405, Chart.JS chart will not load - much effort has been made to debug this but time constraints has led to these still not working currently. Application is uploaded to Heroku.
